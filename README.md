# Guess-The-Number
Fun project that brushes on some programming skills including for/if loops, global/local variables, and the random module!
The user is asked about the difficulty of the game at first. If chosen 'easy', the user has 10 attempts to guess the random number from 1 to 100. If chosen 'hard', the user only has 5 attempts.
